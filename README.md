# micron

### Overview

Micron is a cloud-first framework build on top of the Gin router for rapidly creating Go fullstack services. It is batteries-included (bucking the Go paradigm of "everything from scratch") and offers:

- DB support and integration with Postgres, SQLite, and MySQL
- Caching with Redis
- AWS integration OOB
- RBAC and easy IDP integration
- JWT token auth
- SAML SSO support
- OpenAPI 3.0 Documentation

Micron is designed to allow teams to spin up performant, secure, fully-featured services with a few lines of code, handling the mish-mash of integration work inherent to most Go backend projects.
